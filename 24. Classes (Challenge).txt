**Classes Challenge**:

Create a class Player with the following:
- Add a Name and Country properties
- Add a function that when it runs should print into the console ("Messi was born in Argentina");
- Make sure to adapt this function to receive dynamic Names and Clubs.

Create a Subclass called TennisPlayer that extends from the class Player
- Add a new property Age.
- Add a function that when it runs should print into the console something similar ("Rafael Nadal is 34 years old and knows how to play Tennis");
- Make sure the Name and Age are dynamic.

// Solution 1
// player.js
export class Player {
    constructor(name, country) {
        this.name = name;
        this.country = country;
    }
    info() {
        console.log(`${this.name} was born in ${this.country}`);
    }
}

export class TennisPlayer extends Player{
    constructor(name, country, age) {
        super(name, country);
        this.age = age;
    }
    info() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and knows how to play Tennis`);
    }
}

// index.js
import { Player, TennisPlayer } from './player.js';

let player1 = new TennisPlayer("Rafael Nadal", "Some place", 34)
player1.info();

// Solution 2
class Player {
    constructor(name, country) {
        this.name = name;
        this.country = country;
    }
    
    introduce() {
        console.log(`${this.name} was born in ${this.country}`);
    }
}

const messi = new Player("Messi", "Argentina");

messi.introduce();

class TennisPlayer extends Player {
    constructor(name, country, age) {
        super(name, country);
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    playTennis() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and knows how to play Tennis`);
    }
}

const roger = new TennisPlayer( "Roger Federer", "Spain", 38);

roger.playTennis();
